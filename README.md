# Python-Overview
This is my quick overview of Python, along with a couple of key differences
between Python 2 and Python 3.

My plan is to give you the tools you need to start exploring the features and
flexibility of Python. This overview is divided into three one hour presentations
that include a simple power point presentation followed by a practical section
where I demonstrate key concepts.

If you want a deeper understanding of Python I recommend the course:
